/*
    ADT = Abstract Data Type
    An ADT is a logical model that defines:
        - A collection of data (e.g. a stack, queue, or list)
        - The operations that can be performed on that data 
          (e.g. push, pop, create_stack, print_stack)

    The actual implementation details are hidden.
    Data is accessed only through the provided functions.
